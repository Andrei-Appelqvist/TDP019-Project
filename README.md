Ruby group project for course TDP019. C-kaft is a programming language parsed and executed with Ruby. The language can run files with the ending ck and run in terminal interactively. Look in the test files for syntax and the ruby files for the code.

Run files with > ruby Ckaft.rb [nameoffile]
Example > ruby Ckaft.rb testfile3.ck

Run interacively with > ruby Ckaft.rb
Try for example printing something > print(1+1)
